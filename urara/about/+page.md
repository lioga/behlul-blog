# Who am I?

Hi there! I'm Behlul Sena Akbudak, an engineering and cooking enthusiast studying Electrical and Electronics Engineering at Karadeniz Technical University. I'm passionate about hardware, software, and the magic that happens when they come together.

I love coding, problem-solving, and working on both software and hardware projects. I'm also into AI training, creating synthetic datasets, 3D, and game engines in general.

This blog is where I share my knowledge and experiences. You'll find articles and insights on tech and engineering based on my experince. I hope my journey inspires your own quest for knowledge and innovation.

Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/behlulsena/), check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/lioga), or drop me an [email](mailto:behlulsena09@hotmail.com) for a tech chat. Also you can check out my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hKr-SKl9CF0QkrnWnKnfwf4DoZS0aZZW/view) here. Thanks for joining me on this journey!

Happy reading!
